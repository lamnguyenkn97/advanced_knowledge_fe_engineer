## A learning site to become a senior frontend engineer

This project is aimed at building a learning platform that helps developers advance their skills and knowledge to become senior frontend engineers. It covers a range of essential topics, from mastering JavaScript and TypeScript to advanced React patterns, testing, performance optimization, and architectural best practices.

### Features
- **Progressive Learning Flow**: Learn step by step, starting from intermediate topics and advancing to more complex frontend concepts.
- **Interactive Learning Modules**: Hands-on exercises to practice advanced JavaScript, React, and TypeScript concepts.
- **State Management**: Deep dives into Redux, Zustand, and Context API with practical examples.
- **Performance Optimization**: Learn memoization, lazy loading, and code splitting with practical exercises.
- **Testing Best Practices**: Master unit, integration, and end-to-end testing using Jest and Cypress.
- **Accessible Design**: Ensure your projects are fully accessible by following a11y best practices.
- **CI/CD and Deployment**: Learn to automate testing and deployment using GitHub Actions, CircleCI, or other CI/CD tools.
